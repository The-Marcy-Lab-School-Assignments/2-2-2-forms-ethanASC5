# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
The url changes because adding new info causes the page to reload and update with new info after its entered. This means form is being submitted using its default behavior. This default action also causes the page to refresh.

 

You can stop this by adding event. preventDefault()
